# Lab 7 – Copilot Agents

## Scenario
Leverage GitHub Copilot Agents to orchestrate complex tasks such as drafting CI/CD pipelines, translating configurations, and generating documentation.

## Learning Goals
 
- Use Copilot Agents for multi-step planning.
- Validate generated artifacts and provide feedback loops.
- Capture agent conversations as audit evidence.

## Prerequisites
 
- Completion of Labs 1–6.
- Access to GitHub Copilot Agents (Chat/CLI).

## Exercise 1 – Pipeline Generation
 
1. Prompt the Agent: “Plan a CI/CD pipeline that tests PowerShell scripts, validates YAML, runs Ansible, and publishes artifacts.”
2. Review the plan, request revisions, and store transcript.

## Exercise 2 – Cross-Language Translation
 
1. Provide the Agent with snippets from previous labs.
2. Instruct it to convert PowerShell health checks into an Ansible task and corresponding GitHub Actions step.
3. Ask for validation tests and run them.

## Exercise 3 – Documentation Bundle
 
1. Have the Agent assemble a release runbook summarizing all labs.
2. Request Markdown tables, architecture diagrams (Mermaid), and next steps.
3. Verify accuracy, fix inaccuracies manually, and document corrections.

## Governance Checklist
 
- [ ] Agent output reviewed and adjusted where needed.
- [ ] All generated files committed with provenance notes.
- [ ] Lessons learned captured in repo wiki or docs.

## Stretch Goals
 
- Chain agents for scenario testing (e.g., failure simulation).
- Integrate Agent API with custom tooling for automated reviews.
